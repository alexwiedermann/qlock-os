qlock OS is a minimal but complete smartwatch firmware for the LILYGO T-Display S3 development board. The entire system is navigatable via the two included buttons on the board. This repository and README also contains 3D printable STL and STEP files along with instructions to turn your T-Display S3 board into a smartwatch.

## The System

qlock OS consists of themes and apps. Themes define the watchface (also called the home) along with the system colors. Apps are just applications, interactive little programs.
